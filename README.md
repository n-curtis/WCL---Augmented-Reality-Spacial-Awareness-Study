# WCL- Augmented Reality Spatial Awareness Study

## Synopsis

This project is focused around a study of how spatial awareness and augmented/virtual reality can have an effect on problem solving; in this case the completion of a Rubikâ€™s cube puzzle. This study is being undertaken by an undergraduate as part of the [UniSA Wearable Computer Lab](http://wearables.unisa.edu.au/), part of the [Advanced Computing Research Centre](http://www.unisa.edu.au/Research/Advanced-Computing-Research-Centre/).

## Repository Contents

This repository will contain various parts of the project including, but not limited to:

| Description                                        | Format     |
|----------------------------------------------------|:------------:|
| Unity scripts used in the augmented reality puzzle |     C#     |
| Code for the Arduino controller module             |     C++    |
| Blueprints for the 3D printed prototypes           | .stl, .ipt |
| Hardware and planning designs/sketches             | .png, .txt |

## Motivation

The overall project exists as an introduction into the research environment for the undergraduate, as well as encouraging an entry into further research and/or publication, while this repository itself exists as a way to archive and document the project, allowing the public to get an insight into how this kind of project is approached and handled.

## Installation

The code within this repository is neither complete nor exhaustive. It is not usable for the intended project without other elements such as the unity assets created for the project and the specific hardware/controllers designed for the trials. It stands only as an example to be studied and/or pulled from, rather than readily deployable software.

## Testing and Trials

To be performed.

## Contributors

All code in this repository was designed and written by Nicholas Curtis (unless otherwise indicated).  
All 3D models of shells/cases for 3D printing were also designed by Nicholas Curtis, along with all designs and sketches.  
This project was carried out under supervision of [Professor Bruce Thomas](http://www.unisanet.unisa.edu.au/staff/Homepage.asp?Name=bruce.thomas).
